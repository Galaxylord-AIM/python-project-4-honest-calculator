# Project: Honest Calculator
The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.

## Learning outcomes
Learn how to read flowcharts to hone your understanding of loops, conditions, and algorithms. It will allow you to write your own algorithms. This skill also prevents multiple changes from occurring during production.
